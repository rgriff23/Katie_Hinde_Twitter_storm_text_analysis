# Katie_Hinde_Twitter_storm_text_analysis

The following R scripts were used to compile and analyze data from the Twitterstorm that resulted from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Mammals_Suck/status/874116254767865856):

1. `get_tweets.R` - compiles and cleans replies and quote tweets
2. `get_network.R` - creates social network based on common friends of users involved in the Twitterstorm
3. `analysis.R` - performs analyses using outputs from `get_tweets.R` and `get_network.R`

I wrote a [blog post](https://rgriff23.github.io/2017/06/29/Katie-Hinde-Twitterstorm.html) about my analysis of the Twitterstorm. 

A streamlined version of the data for this project is available on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Twitterstorm_data_the_Katie_Hinde_Target_t-shirt_saga_2017-06-11/6096986), including the raw tweet data, cleaned tweet data, and social network data.
