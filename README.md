The following R scripts were used to compile and analyze data from the Twitterstorm that resulted from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Mammals_Suck/status/874116254767865856):

1. `get_tweets.R` - compiles and cleans replies and quote tweets
2. `get_network.R` - creates social network based on common friends of users involved in the Twitterstorm
3. 

I wrote a [blog post]() about my analysis of the Twitterstorm.
